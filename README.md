## Installation

```bash
npm install @congminh1254/shopee-sdk
```

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 20.0.0

### What You Get
✅ Complete TypeScript definitions for all 27 API managers  
✅ Automatic token refresh and management  
✅ Built-in error handling and retry logic  
✅ Zero dependencies (except node-fetch)  
✅ Full documentation and examples  

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes! Here's how easy it is to integrate with Shopee:

```typescript
import { ShopeeSDK, ShopeeRegion } from '@congminh1254/shopee-sdk';

// 1. Initialize the SDK with your credentials
const sdk = new ShopeeSDK({
  partner_id: 123456,
  partner_key: 'your-partner-key',
  region: ShopeeRegion.GLOBAL,
  shop_id: 789012, // Optional for shop-specific operations
});

// 2. Authenticate your shop (OAuth flow)
const authUrl = sdk.getAuthorizationUrl('https://your-app.com/callback');
console.log('Visit:', authUrl);

// After user authorizes, exchange code for token (automatic token storage!)
await sdk.authenticateWithCode('auth-code-from-callback');

// 3. Start using the API - it's that simple!

// Manage your products
const products = await sdk.product.getItemList({
  offset: 0,
  page_size: 20,
});

// Process orders
const orders = await sdk.order.getOrderList({
  time_range_field: 'create_time',
  time_from: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 86400,
  time_to: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  page_size: 50,
});

// Track shipments
const shipping = await sdk.logistics.getShippingParameter({
  order_sn: '220615ABCDEF',
});

// Handle returns
const returns = await sdk.returns.getReturnList({
  page_size: 20,
});

// And much more - all with full TypeScript support! 🎉
```

**That's it!** The SDK handles token refresh, request signing, error handling, and more automatically.

See the [Setup Guide](./docs/guides/setup.md) and [Authentication Guide](./docs/guides/authentication.md) for detailed instructions.
